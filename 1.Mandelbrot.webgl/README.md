==========================================

original about:
-------------------------------
Julia Map is a Julia set renderer built in HTML 5, WebGL and JavaScript. Each pixel requires the computation of a series of numbers and a measurement of the convergence or divergence of the series. Each image usually consists of millions of numbers. Modern browsers have optimized JavaScript execution up to a point where it is now possible to render fractals like the Julia sets in a few seconds.

We hope you will enjoy exploring the different Julia sets, and share the URLs of the nicest images you discovered.
